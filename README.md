# tours-project-ReactJs ✈️

This is the 2nd project to refresh ReactJs concepts. I am writing an article  about ReactJs main  concepts so I can share it with the community once it's finished.
In this app you can delete the tours offers you are not interested in and refresh the list of tours.
Topics: 

• useEffect() => fetch data. 
•  Conditional Rendering.
